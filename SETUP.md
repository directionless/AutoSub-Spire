# Setup Instructions

## 1. Connect rings to spire

Connect the rings to the white metal spire. Use zipties.

I found this easiest if I balanced the spire on some of the bench like
objects.

## 2. Connect rings to cable

Thread the cable through the rings, starting from the
base. Connect. Be sure not to miss any connectors. (It's okay if there
are unused ones *at the end*)

## 3. Connect the beacon to the top

This involves zipties and tape.

## 4. Test power to the rings.

Plug in, ensure light.

## 5. Connect beacon to power, test

Plug in, ensure all systems light.

## 6. Install on dome

Carry up the dome, you may want two people.

Hold at a slight angle, and attach one bolt. Pivot to vertical, and
attach the second bolt.

## 7. Power on

Apply power and bask in glory
